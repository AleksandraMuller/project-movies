# Project Movies built with React Hooks ðŸŽ¥ ðŸŽ¬ ðŸŽ¥

In this project I use React useState and useEffect hooks to fetch data from an API.
This is my first multi-page React application.

I used [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

## In this project, you will find:

- How to use React router to create multi-page applications
- How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
- APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨

I used functional React to build this project. The project is divided into multiple Components and Pages. If I had more time, I would add dropdown list and a navbar on the first page. Additionally, I would even spent more time on styling my page.
